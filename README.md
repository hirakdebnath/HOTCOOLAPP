## Run Locally

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hirakdebnath/HOTCOOLAPP.git


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
       cd HOTCOOLAPP
   
3. **Build and Run the Kotlin Project**
Kotlin projects are usually built using Gradle or Maven. Check if there's a build.gradle.kts or build. gradle file in the project. To build and run the project, you can use the following commands:

   ```bash
     ./gradlew build

This will download dependencies and build the project. After that, you can run the application:

  ```bash
     ./gradlew run
```
There is a src directory with a main Kotlin file (e.g., MainActivity.kt), you might need to specify the main class or entry point. Check the project's documentation for details.

Access the Application:
Once the application is running, access it through the specified method. If it's a web application, open a web browser and navigate to the provided URL. If it's a command-line application, follow the instructions in the project documentation.

Additional Notes:
Make sure you have Java installed on your machine since Kotlin applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

If the project uses a specific framework or library, ensure that you follow any additional setup steps mentioned in the project's documentation.

If you encounter any issues, check the project's GitHub repository for specific Kotlin-related instructions or seek help in Kotlin forums or communities.
